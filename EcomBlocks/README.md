# Final Year Project - Web app

# Abstract
The Ecom-Blocks is an e-commerce application combined with Blockchain technology that uses Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT). It is a system that includes a mobile application and a web application that facilitates transactions of physical products and their  NFT. It provides a platform for buying and selling products and an NFT minting feature. Business owners experience a plethora of issues in delivering products and services. Similarly, customers do not have a smooth experience getting the product and services. Also, with the current exposure and the popularity of NFT in the market, people are looking forward to possessing both physical and digital versions of the products. Unlike traditional commerce performed physically, e-commerce applications make it easier to make transactions remotely through the Internet. Ecom-Blocks offers the seamless experience of an e-commerce application to business owners and customers and a way to mint NFT.
